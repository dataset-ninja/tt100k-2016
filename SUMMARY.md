**Tsinghua Tencent 100K 2016 Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 16817 images with 29348 labeled objects belonging to 221 different classes including *pn*, *pne*, *i5*, and other: *p11*, *pl40*, *pl50*, *po*, *pl80*, *pl60*, *p26*, *i4*, *pl30*, *io*, *i2*, *pl100*, *p5*, *w57*, *il60*, *pl5*, *p10*, *ip*, *p23*, *il80*, *pl120*, *pr40*, *w59*, *p12*, *p3*, and 193 more.

Images in the Tsinghua Tencent 2016 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 6544 (39% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *other* (7641 images), *train* (6105 images), and *test* (3071 images). The dataset was released in 2016 by the Tsinghua University Beijing, China, Lehigh University Bethlehem, USA, and Tencent Beijing, China.
